# C++ Lesson 2
Date: 7/18/13
Duration: 1.5 Hours

## Goals/Objectives: 

## Ice Breakers + Review/  (5 min):

- Quickly review previous lesson

## Demos (30 minutes): 

### I/O
    - `cout`, `cin`
- Display text, get input, and use it in a sentence: [sentence.cpp](examples/sentence.cpp)
- Addition calculator of 3 numbers: [calculator.cpp](examples/calculator.cpp)
	- after you go over this program with the class, modify it
   		- `int num1, num2, num3, result;`
   	 	- `std::cout << num1 + num2 + num3;`
- `if` statement
    - `if` / `else`
	- Grades: [grades.cpp](examples/grades.cpp)
		- explain why this program is not good
			- introduce concept of else if
    			- modify Grades program by replacing ifs with else ifs
			- introduce concept of else
    			- modify Grades program by replacing the last if with an else

- Boolean / Logical Operators
    - `true` / `false`
    - `0` / `1`
    - `&&`, `||`, `==`

- Switch statement

- While Loop
- For Loop

## Challenges and/or Worktime (45 minutes): 

1. Password
    - Use a `switch` statement
    - If correct number: grant them access
    - If incorrect number: print this computer will explode and countdown from 10
 
2. Infinite Loop / Spamming
    - Use a `while` loop to make the program continuously print something out
    - add `SIGINT` break

3.  

## Evaluation and Closing (10 minutes)
- Review what we have taught
- Answer any remaining questions

## Homework
- Write a program which lets you enter multiple test scores and finds your grade on each.
